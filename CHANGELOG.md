## [Unreleased]

## [v0.3.1] - 2025-08-10

## ðŸŽ‰ Auto-Release from PR #51

**Release Type:** patch  
**Triggered by:** @thsfranca

### ðŸ“‹ Changes from PR #51

**chore: switch auto-release to tag-based versioning; remove VERSION**

What: Move auto-release to derive current version from latest git tag; remove VERSION dependency.

Why: Prevent failures when VERSION is stale; make tags the single source of truth.

Changes:
- tools/release-manager: compute versions from latest tag; stop reading/writing VERSION.
- .github/workflows/auto-release.yml: fetch tags for version computation.
- .github/scripts/release/auto-bump-version.sh: compute next version only; no file writes.
- scripts/create-release-tag.sh: only tag/push; no VERSION commit.
- docs/release-process.md: remove VERSION references; document tag-based flow.
- Remove VERSION file.

CI: No functional changes to language build/tests; release flow now tag-driven.

Testing: All Go tests passing locally.
