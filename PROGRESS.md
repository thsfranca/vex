```vex
42                ; Transpiles to: _ = 42
"hello"          ; Transpiles to: _ = "hello"
(+ 1 2)          ; Transpiles to: _ = 1 + 2
(def x 10)       ; Transpiles to: x := 10
```

---

## Phase 3: Type System & Semantic Analysis ✅ **COMPLETE**

### Goal ✅ **ACHIEVED**
Implement comprehensive type system with inference and semantic validation.

### ✅ What was built:
- [x] **Hindley-Milner type inference engine** with Algorithm W implementation
- [x] **Type unification system** with occur-check and substitution threading
- [x] **Generalization and instantiation** with proper let-polymorphism and value restriction

### ✅ What was learned:
- **Type system design**: Implementing Algorithm W with proper constraint handling
- **Semantic analysis**: Multi-stage analysis with type inference integration
- **Symbol table management**: Scoped environments with package-aware resolution
- **Diagnostic systems**: Structured error reporting with stable codes for AI consumption
- **Type inference algorithms**: Unification, substitution, generalization/instantiation

### ✅ Current Implementation Status:
- **Algorithm W core**: Complete with occur-check and substitution threading
- **Primitive types**: `number`, `string`, `bool` with proper inference
- **Collection types**: Arrays and maps with element/key-value type unification
- **Function types**: Type inference from AST bodies with parameter/return types
- **Record types**: Nominal typing with constructor validation and mismatch detection
- **Package types**: Cross-package type schemes with export enforcement
- **Equality typing**: Polymorphic equality `∀a. a -> a -> bool` with strict validation

---

## HM Type System Roadmap (End-to-End)

- **Algorithm W across all forms**: complete. Strict unification in arrays, maps, `if`, `do`, and calls; no tolerant shortcuts.
- **Builtins via schemes**: equality as `∀a. a -> a -> bool`, arithmetic/comparison as numeric; unified at call sites.
- **Unknown-function policy**: error unless callee has a definition or a scheme.
- **Strict `if` conditions**: enforced; non-boolean is an error.
- **Generalization policy (value restriction)**: implemented for `def`/`defn`; only syntactic values are generalized; instantiate at use.
- **Public vs internal type mapping**: `int`/`float` map to public `number`; arrays/maps recorded properly.
- **Records as nominal types**: construction attaches nominal type constants; outward type is `record`.
- **Package-level schemes**: analyzer accepts exports/ignore/schemes; namespaced calls enforce exports and use schemes when present.
- **Diagnostics**: expected vs got messages for arg mismatches, arrays/maps, if branches; occur-check and arity preserved.
- **Codegen specialization hooks**: groundwork added; further specialization optional.
- **Tests**: added for arrays, let‑polymorphism, value restriction scaffolding, and nominal records; expand for equality and cross‑package typing.
- **Non-goals**: polymorphic recursion without annotations; no subtyping (FFI boundaries use annotations).
- **Optional future**: qualified types (constraints) for numeric/equality.

### Definition of Done (HM Type Checking)

- Algorithm W enforced across arrays, maps, `if`, `do`, and calls with occur‑check.
- Builtins typed via schemes; equality as `∀a. a -> a -> bool`; arithmetic/comparison numeric and unified at calls.
- Unknown functions error unless a definition or a scheme exists.
- `if` conditions must be `bool`; non‑bool is an error.
- Value restriction: generalize only syntactic values at `def`/`defn` (post‑expansion); instantiate at each use.
- Public vs internal types aligned: internal `int`/`float` map to public `number`; arrays/maps surfaced consistently.
- Records nominal: constructors attach nominal type constants; outward type is `record`; unify nominally.
- Package boundary typing: analyzer enforces exports and uses provided type schemes for namespaced local packages.
- Diagnostics: consistent “expected vs got”, arity codes, and occur‑check messages.
- Tests: cover let‑polymorphism, equality typing, array/map mismatches, record nominal mismatches, strict‑if failures, and package‑boundary typing.


## Phase 4: Macro System & Metaprogramming ✅ **BASIC IMPLEMENTATION**

### Goal ✅ **ACHIEVED**
Implement metaprogramming capabilities with user-defined macros.

### ✅ What was built:
- [x] Macro registry with dynamic registration
- [x] Macro expansion with template substitution
- [x] Basic macro preprocessing during compilation
- [x] User-defined macro syntax: `(macro name [params] body)`
- [x] Built-in defn macro for function definitions
- [ ] Integration with type system and semantic analysis (planned)

### ✅ What was learned:
- Metaprogramming system design
- Macro expansion techniques
- Template substitution systems
- Integration with transpiler pipeline

### Working CLI Tool ✅ **ENHANCED IMPLEMENTATION**
```bash
go build -o vex cmd/vex-transpiler/main.go
echo '(def result (+ 10 5))' > test.vx
./vex transpile -input test.vx -output test.go    # With package discovery
./vex run -input test.vx                         # With type checking
./vex build -input test.vx -output test-binary   # With dependency management
./vex test -dir .                                # Test discovery and execution
```

### Current Architecture ✅ **ENHANCED IMPLEMENTATION**
- **Multi-stage compilation pipeline**: Parse → Macro Expansion → Semantic Analysis → Code Generation
- **Advanced transpiler**: Modular design with type-aware code generation (`internal/transpiler/`)
- **Package system integration**: Automatic discovery, dependency resolution, export enforcement
- **HM type system**: Full Algorithm W implementation with inference and checking
- **Advanced macro system**: User-defined macros with template expansion and validation
- **CLI tool**: Complete command suite with `transpile`, `run`, `build`, and `test`

## Phase 4.5: Transpiler Performance Optimization 🚧 **HIGH PRIORITY**

### Goal
Establish a low-overhead baseline for the transpilation pipeline used by CLI commands and improve performance for macro-heavy code.

### What to build:
- [ ] **Transpiler instance reuse** - Keep long-lived `VexTranspiler` instances in CLI to avoid rebuilding parser/analyzer/codegen
- [ ] **Core macro caching** - Make core macro loading a process-wide singleton cache  
- [ ] **Parser/analyzer pooling** - Use `sync.Pool` for ANTLR lexer/parser and analyzer symbol tables
- [ ] **AST-level macro expansion** - Replace reconstruct+reparse loops with direct AST substitution
- [ ] **String building efficiency** - Replace concatenations with `strings.Builder` in macro paths
- [ ] **Adapter optimization** - Align interfaces across analysis/codegen to reduce wrapper objects
- [ ] **Resolver graph caching** - Cache discovered package graphs keyed by module root and file mtimes
- [ ] **CLI build cache reuse** - Use stable temporary directories and Go build cache pathways

### What will be learned:
- **Performance profiling** techniques for compiler pipelines
- **Memory allocation optimization** with pooling and reuse patterns
- **Caching strategies** for compiler intermediate representations
- **Go optimization techniques** for high-frequency allocation scenarios

### Success Criteria:
- `BenchmarkTranspileSimple` < 40µs/op, < 40KB/op, < 600 allocs/op
- `BenchmarkMacro_ExpandChained` < 3µs/op, < 5KB/op, < 100 allocs/op  
- Resolver benchmark shows cached steady-state in sub-10µs/op on repeated runs
- Significant reduction in per-transpile allocations for macro-heavy code

### Package Discovery System Status ✅ **COMPLETE**
**Status**: Fully implemented and integrated across the transpiler pipeline
**Implemented Features**:
- **Directory-based package structure**: One package per directory with automatic name inference
- **Local-first import resolution**: Resolve Vex packages by directory path; fallback to Go imports
- **Automatic dependency scanning**: Build dependency graph from entry file with topological sorting
- **Circular dependency detection**: Compile-time cycle detection with clear error chains and file locations
- **Module root detection**: `vex.pkg` file detection by walking up from entry file
- **Export system**: Parse `(export [symbol...])` declarations with private-by-default enforcement
- **CLI integration**: All commands (`transpile`, `run`, `build`, `test`) automatically discover and include packages
- **Import syntax**: Support for strings, arrays, and alias pairs: `(import ["a" "fmt" ["net/http" http]])`
- **Cross-package typing**: Type schemes for exported symbols with analyzer enforcement

**CLI Workflow**:
```bash
# Automatic package discovery in all commands
./vex run -input main.vx     # Discovers local packages, resolves dependencies
./vex build -input main.vx   # Includes package resolution + Go module management
./vex test -dir .           # Discovers test files across packages
```
