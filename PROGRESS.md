(+ 1 2)          ; Transpiles to: _ = 1 + 2
(def x 10)       ; Transpiles to: x := 10
```

---

## Phase 3: Type System & Semantic Analysis ✅ **COMPLETE**

### Goal ✅ **ACHIEVED**
Implement comprehensive type system with inference and semantic validation.

### ✅ What was built:
- [x] **Hindley-Milner type inference engine** with Algorithm W implementation
- [x] **Type unification system** with occur-check and substitution threading

- **Semantic analysis**: Multi-stage analysis with type inference integration
- **Symbol table management**: Scoped environments with package-aware resolution
- **Diagnostic systems**: Structured error reporting with stable codes for AI consumption

- **Collection types**: Arrays and maps with element/key-value type unification
- **Function types**: Type inference from AST bodies with parameter/return types
- **Record types**: Nominal typing with constructor validation and mismatch detection
- **Package types**: Cross-package type schemes with export enforcement
- **Equality typing**: Polymorphic equality `∀a. a -> a -> bool` with strict validation

---

## HM Type System Roadmap (End-to-End)

- **Algorithm W across all forms**: complete. Strict unification in arrays, maps, `if`, `do`, and calls; no tolerant shortcuts.
- **Builtins via schemes**: equality as `∀a. a -> a -> bool`, arithmetic/comparison as numeric; unified at call sites.
- **Unknown-function policy**: error unless callee has a definition or a scheme.
- **Strict `if` conditions**: enforced; non-boolean is an error.
- **Generalization policy (value restriction)**: implemented for `def`/`defn`; only syntactic values are generalized; instantiate at use.
- **Public vs internal type mapping**: `int`/`float` map to public `number`; arrays/maps recorded properly.
- **Records as nominal types**: construction attaches nominal type constants; outward type is `record`.
- **Package-level schemes**: analyzer accepts exports/ignore/schemes; namespaced calls enforce exports and use schemes when present.
- **Diagnostics**: expected vs got messages for arg mismatches, arrays/maps, if branches; occur-check and arity preserved.
- **Codegen specialization hooks**: groundwork added; further specialization optional.
- **Tests**: added for arrays, let‑polymorphism, value restriction scaffolding, and nominal records; expand for equality and cross‑package typing.
- **Non-goals**: polymorphic recursion without annotations; no subtyping (FFI boundaries use annotations).
- **Optional future**: qualified types (constraints) for numeric/equality.

### Definition of Done (HM Type Checking)

- Algorithm W enforced across arrays, maps, `if`, `do`, and calls with occur‑check.
- Builtins typed via schemes; equality as `∀a. a -> a -> bool`; arithmetic/comparison numeric and unified at calls.
- Unknown functions error unless a definition or a scheme exists.
- `if` conditions must be `bool`; non‑bool is an error.
- Value restriction: generalize only syntactic values at `def`/`defn` (post‑expansion); instantiate at each use.
- Public vs internal types aligned: internal `int`/`float` map to public `number`; arrays/maps surfaced consistently.
- Records nominal: constructors attach nominal type constants; outward type is `record`; unify nominally.
- Package boundary typing: analyzer enforces exports and uses provided type schemes for namespaced local packages.
- Diagnostics: consistent “expected vs got”, arity codes, and occur‑check messages.
- Tests: cover let‑polymorphism, equality typing, array/map mismatches, record nominal mismatches, strict‑if failures, and package‑boundary typing.


## Phase 4: Macro System & Metaprogramming ✅ **COMPLETE**

- `BenchmarkMacro_ExpandChained` < 3µs/op, < 5KB/op, < 100 allocs/op  
- Resolver benchmark shows cached steady-state in sub-10µs/op on repeated runs
- Significant reduction in per-transpile allocations for macro-heavy code
- CLI responsiveness: `vex run` startup time < 100ms for typical programs

---

## Phase 4.6-4.8: Real Execution-Based Coverage ✅ **COMPLETE**

### Goal ✅ **ACHIEVED**
Implement production-ready test coverage using real execution data from Go runtime instrumentation instead of static analysis or heuristics.

### ✅ What was built:

### ✅ Technical Implementation:
```go
// Real coverage collection during test execution
run = exec.CommandContext(ctx, "go", "run", "-cover", src)
run.Env = append(os.Environ(), "GOCOVERDIR="+coverageDir)

// Parse actual execution data
parts := strings.Fields(line)
count := parts[2]
if count != "0" {
    filesCovered[filename] = true  // Only count actually executed code
}
```

### ✅ Sample Output:
```
