## Phase 1: Parser Foundation ✅ **COMPLETED**

### What Was Built
- [x] ANTLR4 grammar for Vex syntax (`tools/grammar/Vex.g4`)
- [x] Multi-language parser generation (Go, Java, Python, C++, JavaScript)
- [x] Go parser successfully generated (`tools/gen/go/`)
- [x] Example Vex programs (`examples/`)
- [x] Project documentation and README
- [x] Implementation requirements document

### Key Achievements
- **Grammar supports**: S-expressions, arrays, symbols, strings, comments, nested structures
- **Working parsers**: Can parse valid Vex syntax into AST
- **Go integration**: Generated Go parser ready for next phase
- **Foundation set**: Clear roadmap and project structure

### Technical Decisions Made
- Chose Go transpilation over other backend strategies for performance and concurrency
- Decided on static typing for performance, thread safety, and AI predictability
- Established Lisp-inspired S-expression syntax optimized for AI generation
- **AI-First Design**: Prioritized uniform syntax patterns over syntactic sugar
- **Scalable HTTP Focus**: Every Vex program naturally handles multiple HTTP requests simultaneously
- **Inherent Thread Safety**: Immutable data structures make concurrency automatic and safe
- **Natural Scalability**: HTTP requests automatically run in lightweight threads

---

## Phase 2: Basic Transpilation ✅ **COMPLETE**

### Goal ✅ **ACHIEVED**
Establish core transpilation capability from Vex AST to executable Go code.

### ✅ What was built:
- [x] Transpiler framework that converts AST to Go code
- [x] Basic value transpilation (numbers, strings, symbols)
- [x] Simple arithmetic expressions
- [x] Variable definitions
- [x] CLI tool for command-line transpilation
- [x] Integrated ANTLR parser with error handling
- [x] AST visitor pattern for code generation

### ✅ What was learned:
- Code generation patterns
- AST traversal for transpilation
- Go code structure and syntax generation
- ANTLR parser integration

### ✅ Success Criteria Achieved:
```vex
42                ; Transpiles to: _ = 42
"hello"          ; Transpiles to: _ = "hello"
(+ 1 2)          ; Transpiles to: _ = 1 + 2
(def x 10)       ; Transpiles to: x := 10
```

## Phase 3: Type System & Semantic Analysis ⏳ **PLANNED**

### Goal

## Phase 4: Macro System & Metaprogramming ✅ **BASIC IMPLEMENTATION**

### Goal ✅ **ACHIEVED**
Implement metaprogramming capabilities with user-defined macros.

### ✅ What was built:
- [x] Macro registry with dynamic registration
- [x] Macro expansion with template substitution
- [x] Basic macro preprocessing during compilation
- [x] User-defined macro syntax: `(macro name [params] body)`
- [x] Built-in defn macro for function definitions
- [ ] Integration with type system and semantic analysis (planned)

### ✅ What was learned:
- Metaprogramming system design
- Macro expansion techniques
- Template substitution systems
- Integration with transpiler pipeline

### Working CLI Tool
```bash
go build -o vex cmd/vex-transpiler/main.go
echo '(def result (+ 10 5))' > test.vex
./vex transpile -input test.vex -output test.go
./vex run -input test.vex
./vex build -input test.vex -output test-binary
```

### Current Architecture ✅ **BASIC IMPLEMENTATION**
