A statically-typed functional programming language that transpiles to Go, designed for AI code generation and concurrent HTTP request handling, while exploring language implementation concepts and functional programming paradigms.

## Overview

Vex is an experimental programming language that combines functional programming principles with static typing, inspired by Lisp syntax and **specifically designed to be easily generated by AI models while handling multiple HTTP requests simultaneously**. It transpiles to Go for maximum performance and leverages S-expression syntax to create predictable, uniform code patterns that AI can reliably understand and generate for concurrent web services.

This is a **study project created for educational purposes and fun** - exploring how language design can optimize for AI code generation while building a complete language implementation from scratch.

### ðŸ¤– **AI-First + Concurrent HTTP Design Philosophy**

Vex is designed with two primary goals:

**ðŸ§  AI Code Generation**:
- **Uniform S-expression syntax**: Everything follows `(operation args...)` pattern, eliminating precedence rules and syntax complexity
- **Predictable structure**: Consistent patterns that AI models can learn and replicate reliably  
- **Semantic clarity**: Function names and operations clearly express intent
- **Composable building blocks**: Simple operations that combine into complex functionality
- **Minimal cognitive load**: Fewer syntax rules mean AI can focus on logic rather than parsing edge cases

**âš¡ Concurrent HTTP Performance**:
- **Goroutine-based concurrency**: Each HTTP request runs in its own lightweight thread
- **Functional immutability**: Thread-safe by design with immutable data structures
- **Go's performance**: Direct transpilation to Go for native concurrency and speed
- **Stateless patterns**: Functional design naturally supports concurrent request handling
- **Built-in HTTP patterns**: Language constructs optimized for web service development

## Language Vision

Vex aims to be a functional programming language optimized for AI generation and concurrent HTTP handling with:

- **AI-friendly syntax**: S-expressions provide uniform, predictable structure for AI models
- **Thread-safe by design**: Functional immutability means every program safely handles concurrent requests
- **Static typing** with type inference for performance and thread safety  
- **Semantic annotations**: Built-in metadata to guide AI code generation
- **Go transpilation** for native performance, concurrency, and ecosystem access
- **HTTP service focus** with built-in patterns for scalable web APIs and authentication
- **Composable patterns**: Simple building blocks that AI can combine into scalable solutions

### ðŸŽ¯ **Perfect for AI Code Generation + Concurrent HTTP**

Vex's design makes it ideal for AI-assisted development of concurrent web services:

```vex
;; AI can easily generate HTTP handlers that are naturally concurrent:
(defn api-endpoint [request]
  (-> request
      (validate-input)
      (process-data)            ; Always thread-safe by design
      (format-response)))

;; AI can generate HTTP servers that handle thousands of requests:
(http-server
  :port 8080
  :routes [
    (GET "/users" get-users)    ; Each request runs in its own goroutine
    (POST "/data" process-data) ; Thread-safe through immutable design
  ])
```

The uniform S-expression structure + functional design means AI models can:
- **Learn patterns quickly**: Same structure for all operations
- **Generate thread-safe code automatically**: Immutable data = no concurrency bugs
- **Scale automatically**: Every program handles thousands of concurrent requests
- **Focus on logic**: No syntax complexity, no concurrency complexity

### Current Status: Advanced Type System and Package Discovery âœ…

The project currently includes:
- **ANTLR4 grammar** for S-expressions, arrays, symbols, strings, and records
- **Advanced transpiler** with multi-stage compilation pipeline (parse â†’ macro expansion â†’ semantic analysis â†’ code generation)
- **Hindley-Milner type system** with Algorithm W, type inference, generalization/instantiation, and strict type checking
- **Package discovery system** with directory-based packages, import resolution, circular dependency detection, and export enforcement
- **CLI tool** (`vex`) with `transpile`, `run`, `build`, and `test` commands
- **Structured diagnostics** with stable error codes and AI-friendly formatting (VEX-TYP-UNDEF, VEX-TYP-COND, VEX-TYP-EQ, VEX-TYP-ARRAY-ELEM, VEX-TYP-MAP-KEY/VAL, VEX-TYP-REC-NOMINAL)
- **Core language features**:
  - Variable definitions: `(def x 10)` â†’ `x := 10`
  - Arithmetic expressions: `(+ 1 2)` â†’ `1 + 2` with type checking
  - Import system: `(import "fmt")` â†’ `import "fmt"` with module detection
  - Go function calls: `(fmt/Println "Hello")` â†’ `fmt.Println("Hello")`
  - Basic arrays: `[1 2 3]` â†’ `[]interface{}{1, 2, 3}` with element type unification
  - Conditional expressions: `(if condition then else)` â†’ Go if statements with boolean condition enforcement
  - Sequential execution: `(do expr1 expr2)` â†’ Multiple Go statements
  - Advanced macro system: `(macro name [params] body)` â†’ Full macro registration and expansion
  - Record declarations: `(record Person [name: string age: number])` â†’ Nominal type validation (analyzer complete, codegen in progress)
  - Package system: Directory-based packages with automatic discovery and export enforcement
- **Quality infrastructure**:
  - Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with automated quality checks  
  - Automated release process with PR label-based version management
  - Grammar validation system testing both valid and invalid syntax
  - VSCode extension with syntax highlighting and language support
  - Extensive test coverage (85%+ target) with benchmarking

### Working Today ðŸš€

You can transpile, run, build, and test Vex programs:

```bash
# Build the transpiler
go build -o vex cmd/vex-transpiler/main.go

# Transpile to Go
echo '(def x (+ 5 3))' > example.vx
./vex transpile -input example.vx -output example.go

# Compile and execute everything
./vex run -input example.vx

# Build a binary executable
./vex build -input example.vx -output hello-world

# Run tests
./vex test -dir .
```

Outputs valid, type-checked Go code:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Generated by Vex transpiler
    x := 5 + 3
    _ = x // Return last defined value
}
```

**Command Overview:**
- **`transpile`** - Convert Vex source code to Go (for inspection or integration)
- **`run`** - Compile and execute Vex programs directly (includes package discovery and core macros)
- **`build`** - Create standalone binary executables with dependency management
- **`test`** - Discover and run `*_test.vx` files with test macros

**Current Features Working:**
```vex
;; Import Go packages (with module detection)
(import "fmt")
(import ["fmt" "os"])  ; Multiple imports
(import [["net/http" http]])  ; Aliased imports

;; Variables with type inference
(def message "Hello from Vex!")
(def count 42)
(def result (+ (* 10 5) (- 20 5)))  ; Type-checked arithmetic

;; Go function calls with proper typing
(fmt/Println message)
(fmt/Printf "Count: %d\n" count)

;; Arrays with element type unification
(def numbers [1 2 3 4])
(def names ["Alice" "Bob" "Charlie"])

;; Conditional expressions with boolean enforcement
(if (> count 0) 
    (fmt/Println "positive") 
    (fmt/Println "non-positive"))

;; Sequential execution
(do
  (def x 10)
  (def y 20)
  (fmt/Println (+ x y)))

;; Macro definitions with full expansion
(macro greet [name] (fmt/Printf "Hello, %s!\n" name))
(greet "World")

;; Record declarations with nominal typing
(record Person [name: string age: number])
(record Point [x: number y: number])
;; Record construction and access (analyzer validates, codegen in progress)

;; Package system with exports
;; In package file:
(export [add multiply])
(def add (fn [x y] (+ x y)))
;; In main file:
(import ["mypackage"])
(def result (mypackage/add 5 3))
```

### Example Vex Code (Vision)

Here's what AI-friendly Vex programs might look like when fully implemented:

```vex
;; AI can easily generate HTTP endpoints that are inherently thread-safe
(defn get-user-profile
  ^{:http-endpoint "/api/users/:id"
    :method "GET"
    :auth-required true
    :returns "application/json"}
  [request]
  (-> request
      (extract-user-id)
      (fetch-user-from-db)         ; Always non-blocking
      (format-json-response)))

;; AI generates authentication that naturally handles thousands of logins
(defn login-endpoint
  ^{:purpose "authenticate-user"
    :security "high"
    :returns "jwt-token"}
  [request]
  (-> request
      (validate-credentials)
      (create-jwt-token)
      (json-response)))

;; AI composes systems that automatically scale to handle any load
(http-server
  :port 8080
  :routes [
    (GET "/api/users" list-users :jwt-auth)      ; Scales to millions of requests
    (POST "/api/login" login-endpoint)           ; Thread-safe by design
    (PUT "/api/users/:id" update-user :jwt-auth) ; No concurrency complexity
  ])
```

**Why AI-generated Vex code is naturally scalable:**
- **Uniform structure**: Everything is `(operation args...)` - always thread-safe
- **Immutable by default**: No shared mutable state = impossible to have concurrency bugs
- **Functional composition**: `(-> data transform1 transform2)` is inherently thread-safe
- **One pattern**: AI learns simple patterns that automatically scale
- **Go's goroutines**: Every AI-generated program scales to millions of requests

## Grammar Rules

The main grammar rules are:

- `program`: The root rule, matches one or more lists followed by EOF
- `list`: Matches `(` followed by elements followed by `)`
- `array`: Matches `[` followed by elements followed by `]`
- Elements can be: arrays, lists, symbols, or strings
- Supports arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and other symbols
 - Arrays are heterogeneous at the language level and target Go's `[]interface{}`

## Structured Diagnostics (AI-friendly)

The compiler emits structured diagnostics with stable codes and predictable formatting (see `docs/error-messages.md`).

Text format (Go-style):

```
path/to/file.vx:LINE:COL: error: [VEX-TYP-IF-MISMATCH]: branch types differ
Expected: type(then) == type(else)
Got: then=int, else=string
Suggestion: make both branches the same type or add explicit cast.
```

Machine format (future `--machine` flag):

```json
{ "code":"VEX-TYP-IF-MISMATCH","file":"main.vx","line":12,"col":3,
  "message":"branch types differ",
  "params":{"Expected":"same-type","Got":{"then":"int","else":"string"}},
  "suggestion":"make-branches-same-type" }
```

Implementation lives in `internal/transpiler/diagnostics` with a code catalog and text/JSON renderers. Analyzer and resolver use these to produce consistent, AI-friendly errors.

## Learning Goals

This project explores key language implementation concepts with a focus on AI-friendly design:

- **AI-Optimized Language Design** - How to create syntax that AI models can reliably understand and generate
- **Lexing and Parsing** with ANTLR4 for uniform S-expression handling
- **Semantic Annotations** - Embedding meaning in code to guide AI generation
- **Type Systems** optimized for AI understanding and code generation
- **Code Generation** and transpilation to high-performance Go
- **HTTP Service Patterns** - Building AI-friendly frameworks for web development
- **Functional Programming** language design principles

### Test Coverage Standard

This project enforces a single, simple coverage rule in CI:

- Overall coverage for `internal/transpiler` must be at least **85%**
- Generated parser code at `internal/transpiler/parser` is **excluded** from coverage
- PRs fail if coverage drops below the threshold

The PR report shows only the current coverage and the target threshold, in line with the projectâ€™s preference for simple coverage comments.

## Release Process

Vex uses an automated release system triggered by PR labels:

- **`release:patch`** - Bug fixes and minor improvements
- **`release:minor`** - New features and enhancements  
- **`release:major`** - Breaking changes

When a PR with a release label is merged to `main`, the system automatically:
1. Bumps the version number
2. Creates a Git tag
3. Generates release notes
4. Updates the changelog

See [docs/release-process.md](docs/release-process.md) for detailed information.

## Contributing

This is a personal study project, but feel free to:
- Test the grammar validation system
- Suggest language design ideas
- Report issues with the grammar or tooling
- Fork for your own experiments
