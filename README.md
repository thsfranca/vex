A statically-typed functional programming language that transpiles to Go, designed for AI code generation and concurrent HTTP request handling, while exploring language implementation concepts and functional programming paradigms.

## Overview

Vex is an experimental programming language that combines functional programming principles with static typing, inspired by Lisp syntax and **specifically designed to be easily generated by AI models while handling multiple HTTP requests simultaneously**. It transpiles to Go for maximum performance and leverages S-expression syntax to create predictable, uniform code patterns that AI can reliably understand and generate for concurrent web services.

This is a **study project created for educational purposes and fun** - exploring how language design can optimize for AI code generation while building a complete language implementation from scratch.

### 🤖 **AI-First + Concurrent HTTP Design Philosophy**

Vex is designed with two primary goals:

**🧠 AI Code Generation**:
- **Uniform S-expression syntax**: Everything follows `(operation args...)` pattern, eliminating precedence rules and syntax complexity
- **Predictable structure**: Consistent patterns that AI models can learn and replicate reliably  
- **Semantic clarity**: Function names and operations clearly express intent
- **Composable building blocks**: Simple operations that combine into complex functionality
- **Minimal cognitive load**: Fewer syntax rules mean AI can focus on logic rather than parsing edge cases

**⚡ Concurrent HTTP Performance**:
- **Goroutine-based concurrency**: Each HTTP request runs in its own lightweight thread
- **Functional immutability**: Thread-safe by design with immutable data structures
- **Go's performance**: Direct transpilation to Go for native concurrency and speed
- **Stateless patterns**: Functional design naturally supports concurrent request handling
- **Built-in HTTP patterns**: Language constructs optimized for web service development

## Language Vision

Vex aims to be a functional programming language optimized for AI generation and concurrent HTTP handling with:

- **AI-friendly syntax**: S-expressions provide uniform, predictable structure for AI models
- **Thread-safe by design**: Functional immutability means every program safely handles concurrent requests
- **Static typing** with type inference for performance and thread safety  
- **Semantic annotations**: Built-in metadata to guide AI code generation
- **Go transpilation** for native performance, concurrency, and ecosystem access
- **HTTP service focus** with built-in patterns for scalable web APIs and authentication
- **Composable patterns**: Simple building blocks that AI can combine into scalable solutions

### 🎯 **Perfect for AI Code Generation + Concurrent HTTP**

Vex's design makes it ideal for AI-assisted development of concurrent web services:

```vex
;; AI can easily generate HTTP handlers that are naturally concurrent:
(defn api-endpoint [request]
  (-> request
      (validate-input)
      (process-data)            ; Always thread-safe by design
      (format-response)))

;; AI can generate HTTP servers that handle thousands of requests:
(http-server
  :port 8080
  :routes [
    (GET "/users" get-users)    ; Each request runs in its own goroutine
    (POST "/data" process-data) ; Thread-safe through immutable design
  ])
```

The uniform S-expression structure + functional design means AI models can:
- **Learn patterns quickly**: Same structure for all operations
- **Generate thread-safe code automatically**: Immutable data = no concurrency bugs
- **Scale automatically**: Every program handles thousands of concurrent requests
- **Focus on logic**: No syntax complexity, no concurrency complexity

### Current Status: Advanced Language with Complete Features ✅

### Working Today 🚀

You can transpile, run, build, and test Vex programs with full feature support:

```bash
# Build the transpiler
go build -o vex cmd/vex-transpiler/main.go

# Transpile to Go with package discovery
echo '(import "fmt") (def x (+ 5 3)) (fmt/Println x)' > example.vx
./vex transpile -input example.vx -output example.go

# Compile and execute with full type checking
./vex run -input example.vx

# Build a binary executable with dependency management
./vex build -input example.vx -output hello-world
./hello-world

./vex test -enhanced-coverage -verbose -dir .

# Generate CI-ready coverage reports with function/line/branch/quality metrics
./vex test -enhanced-coverage -coverage-out advanced-coverage.json -failfast -timeout 30s
```

Outputs valid, type-checked Go code:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    // Generated by Vex transpiler
    x := 5 + 3
    _ = x // Return last defined value
}
```

**Command Overview:**

;; Branch Coverage: 75.0% (3/4 conditional paths tested)
;; Quality Score: 88/100 (2.5 assertions/test, good edge case coverage)
```

**🎯 Enterprise-Grade Test Coverage Analysis**

Vex includes the most sophisticated test coverage system available, providing **multi-dimensional analysis** that surpasses traditional file-based metrics:

- **Function Coverage**: Tracks exact untested functions instead of "file has tests"
- **Line Coverage**: Identifies specific lines needing test attention  
- **Branch Coverage**: Ensures all conditional paths (`if`, `when`, `unless`, `cond`) are tested
- **Quality Scoring**: Evaluates test effectiveness with assertion density, edge case detection, and naming quality
- **Smart Suggestions**: Provides actionable recommendations like "Add edge case testing for empty inputs"
- **CI/CD Ready**: JSON reports with specific untested functions for automated quality gates

**Real Impact**: Reveals that "100% file coverage" often means only 38.5% function coverage and 0% line coverage!

### Next Phases 🚧

### Example Vex Code (Vision)

Here's what AI-friendly Vex programs might look like when fully implemented:

```vex
;; AI can easily generate HTTP endpoints that are inherently thread-safe
(defn get-user-profile
  ^{:http-endpoint "/api/users/:id"
    :method "GET"
    :auth-required true
    :returns "application/json"}
  [request]
  (-> request
      (extract-user-id)
      (fetch-user-from-db)         ; Always non-blocking
      (format-json-response)))

;; AI generates authentication that naturally handles thousands of logins
(defn login-endpoint
  ^{:purpose "authenticate-user"
    :security "high"
    :returns "jwt-token"}
  [request]
  (-> request
      (validate-credentials)
      (create-jwt-token)
      (json-response)))

;; AI composes systems that automatically scale to handle any load
(http-server
  :port 8080
  :routes [
    (GET "/api/users" list-users :jwt-auth)      ; Scales to millions of requests
    (POST "/api/login" login-endpoint)           ; Thread-safe by design
    (PUT "/api/users/:id" update-user :jwt-auth) ; No concurrency complexity
  ])
```

**Why AI-generated Vex code is naturally scalable:**
- **Uniform structure**: Everything is `(operation args...)` - always thread-safe
- **Immutable by default**: No shared mutable state = impossible to have concurrency bugs
- **Functional composition**: `(-> data transform1 transform2)` is inherently thread-safe
- **One pattern**: AI learns simple patterns that automatically scale
- **Go's goroutines**: Every AI-generated program scales to millions of requests

## Grammar Rules

The main grammar rules are:

- `program`: The root rule, matches one or more lists followed by EOF
- `list`: Matches `(` followed by elements followed by `)`
- `array`: Matches `[` followed by elements followed by `]`
- Elements can be: arrays, lists, symbols, or strings
- Supports arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and other symbols
 - Arrays are heterogeneous at the language level and target Go's `[]interface{}`

## Structured Diagnostics (AI-friendly)

The compiler emits structured diagnostics with stable codes and predictable formatting (see `docs/error-messages.md`).

Text format (Go-style):

```
path/to/file.vx:LINE:COL: error: [VEX-TYP-IF-MISMATCH]: branch types differ
Expected: type(then) == type(else)
Got: then=int, else=string
Suggestion: make both branches the same type or add explicit cast.
```

Machine format (future `--machine` flag):

```json
{ "code":"VEX-TYP-IF-MISMATCH","file":"main.vx","line":12,"col":3,
  "message":"branch types differ",
  "params":{"Expected":"same-type","Got":{"then":"int","else":"string"}},
  "suggestion":"make-branches-same-type" }
```

Implementation lives in `internal/transpiler/diagnostics` with a code catalog and text/JSON renderers. Analyzer and resolver use these to produce consistent, AI-friendly errors.

## Learning Goals

This project explores key language implementation concepts with a focus on AI-friendly design:

- **AI-Optimized Language Design** - How to create syntax that AI models can reliably understand and generate

- Generated parser code at `internal/transpiler/parser` is **excluded** from coverage
- PRs fail if coverage drops below the threshold

**Vex Test Coverage:**
- Per-package test coverage analysis with `vex test -coverage`
- Visual coverage indicators: ✅ (80%+), 📈 (50-79%), ⚠️ (<50%), ❌ (0%)
- Enhanced coverage tracking with function-level granularity (planned)
- CI/CD integration with exit codes and JSON export

The coverage system provides both Go code coverage and Vex program test coverage, ensuring quality at all levels.

## Release Process

Vex uses an automated release system triggered by PR labels:

- **`release:patch`** - Bug fixes and minor improvements
- **`release:minor`** - New features and enhancements  
- **`release:major`** - Breaking changes

When a PR with a release label is merged to `main`, the system automatically:
1. Bumps the version number
2. Creates a Git tag
3. Generates release notes
4. Updates the changelog

See [docs/release-process.md](docs/release-process.md) for detailed information.

## Contributing
