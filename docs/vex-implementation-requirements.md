# Vex Language Implementation Requirements - Data Engineering Specialization

## Overview

Vex is a statically-typed functional programming language specialized for data engineering, ETL pipelines, stream processing, and real-time analytics. It transpiles to Go for excellent performance while providing clean S-expression syntax optimized for data transformation workflows. This document outlines the complete implementation roadmap focused on data engineering excellence.

## Core Design Principles

**🚀 Data Engineering Excellence**: Specialized for ETL pipelines, stream processing, and real-time analytics with functional programming paradigms that ensure safe, predictable data transformations.

**⚡ High-Performance Data Processing**: Go's concurrency and performance characteristics optimized for high-throughput data workloads and sub-millisecond real-time analytics.

**🔒 Type-Safe Data Pipelines**: Compile-time type checking prevents runtime failures in production data workflows, ensuring reliable ETL operations and stream processing.

**🌊 Stream Processing Focus**: Built-in support for real-time data streams, windowing operations, backpressure handling, and complex event processing using Go's goroutines.

**🔗 Data Ecosystem Integration**: Seamless interoperability with databases, message queues, data warehouses, and analytics platforms through Go's excellent ecosystem.

**🎯 Operational Simplicity**: Single binary deployment vs. complex cluster management (Kafka, Spark, Flink), reducing operational overhead for data engineering teams.

**🧩 Functional Data Transformations**: Immutable data structures and pure functions create reliable, debuggable data transformation pipelines with clear audit trails.

### Data Engineering Language Goals

**Pipeline Clarity**: S-expressions make complex ETL and stream processing workflows readable and maintainable, with `(-> data transform1 transform2)` patterns expressing data flow naturally.

**Data Transformation Excellence**: Function names and operations clearly express data operations, making pipelines self-documenting and easier to debug in production.

**Composable Data Operations**: Simple transformation building blocks that data engineers can combine into complex ETL workflows, stream processing, and real-time analytics.

**Predictable Data Flow**: Consistent patterns for data ingestion, transformation, and emission that create reliable, production-ready data pipelines.

**Minimal Operational Complexity**: Fewer moving parts than traditional data platforms (no JVM tuning, cluster configuration, or complex dependencies), allowing teams to focus on data logic rather than infrastructure management.

## Implementation Architecture Guidelines

### **Hybrid Implementation Strategy**

Vex adopts a **hybrid approach** that strategically divides functionality between core language features and external libraries:

- **Core Language (20% of features, 80% of usage)**: Essential data engineering primitives built into Vex
- **External Libraries (80% of features, 20% of critical path)**: Specialized connectors and domain-specific functionality

For comprehensive implementation guidelines, see [Implementation Guidelines](implementation-guidelines.md).

### **Core vs. External Decision Framework**

| Component Type | Implementation | Rationale | Examples |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|----------|
| **Stream Processing Primitives** | Core Language | Fundamental to data engineering | `defstream`, `defpipeline`, `defpattern` |
| **Windowing Operations** | Core Language | Essential for real-time processing | `window-tumbling`, `window-sliding` |
| **Data Flow Control** | Core Language | Performance critical | `with-backpressure`, `parallel-map` |
| **Statistical Functions** | Standard Library | Common but specialized | `mean`, `percentile`, `moving-average` |
| **Database Connectors** | External Libraries | Multiple vendors/protocols | `vex.connectors.postgres` |
| **Cloud Integrations** | External Libraries | Platform-specific | `vex.cloud.aws` |
